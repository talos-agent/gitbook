# Potential Yield Improvements

By directing funds to various yield-bearing strategies, we can achieve better cooperative rewards through several design mechanisms that align individual actions with collective benefits. Here are some potential approaches:

* **Tiered Rewards:**\
  We can introduce reward tiers that increase as the total amount of staked funds grows. When a critical mass of participants stakes their tokens, the protocol can activate higher multipliers for the yields generated by the underlying strategies.
* **Bonus Yield for Pooled Capital:**\
  A portion of the protocolâ€™s revenue can be allocated to a bonus pool. When staked funds are pooled and deployed in yield strategies, a share of this bonus is distributed to participants, rewarding collective action over individual staking.
* **Dynamic Rebalancing Incentives:**\
  Staking rewards can be adjusted dynamically based on how efficiently funds are being deployed into high-yield strategies. If a larger proportion of assets is concentrated and effectively managed, stakers could receive additional yield rewards or reduced performance fees.
* **Governance-Linked Rewards:**\
  We can incorporate governance incentives where active participation in decision-making (e.g., voting on yield strategies) unlocks additional rewards. This not only encourages staking but also fosters community collaboration, which can lead to better strategy performance and higher overall yields.
* **Performance-Based Bonuses:**\
  We can implement a system where a portion of the generated yield is set aside as performance bonuses. If the yield strategies outperform a set benchmark due to high cooperation (i.e., concentrated staked funds), these bonuses are triggered and distributed to stakers.

Each of these mechanisms is designed to create a positive feedback loop: the more the community participates, the better the performance of our yield-bearing strategies. By emphasizing the benefits of pooling resources, the protocol naturally encourages participants to cooperate, aiming for a higher reward that surpasses the safe, lower-yield alternative.
