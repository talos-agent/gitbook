# Vault Strategies

Talos's treasury is managed by the AI Protocol Owner, which uses a powerful engine to deploy assets into high-yield opportunities using multi-vault strategies. We use the ERC4626 standard to ensure that every vault is secure, interoperable, and transparent, providing a consistent framework for dynamic asset allocation and real-time rebalancing.

### The Benefits of ERC4626

* **Standardization:**\
  ERC4626 provides a uniform API for all vaults, which simplifies integration with other protocols and improves security.
* **Interoperability:**\
  With a consistent framework, Talos can easily move capital between vaults, allowing for seamless rebalancing as the protocol converts vault holdings back to our base asset, ETH.
* **Transparency and Composability:**\
  The standardized nature of ERC4626 allows for clear performance tracking of each vault. This transparency enables our AI to layer and combine strategies for maximum capital efficiency.

### Advanced Multi-Vault Strategies

Talos uses complex strategies to optimize the treasury's yield and risk profile:

1. **Dynamic Rebalancing:**\
   All vaults use ETH as the deposit and withdrawal token. By using the `convertToAssets` function, Talos can convert vault holdings into their equivalent ETH value. This allows for:
   * **Seamless Rebalancing:** Assets can be reallocated across different vaults based on real-time performance.
   * **Standardized Valuation:** ETH serves as a consistent baseline for assessing risk and reward across all vaults.
   * **Optimal Capital Deployment:** The AI continuously monitors performance and shifts capital to vaults with higher yield or better risk-adjusted returns.
2. **Complex Strategy Formulation:**
   * **Multi-Asset Leverage:** The protocol can deploy ETH into vaults that then invest in derivatives, lending, or liquidity pools.
   * **Yield Optimization:** The AI evaluates real-time market data and directs assets to where they can generate the highest yield.
   * **Risk Management:** Converting all vault values to ETH provides a unified risk metric, allowing for a balanced and diversified treasury.

### The Role of AI

The Talos AI is at the heart of our vault strategy:

* **Real-Time Market Analysis:** It continuously monitors the Arbitrum ecosystem to find and capitalize on yield opportunities.
* **Automated Rebalancing:** It executes the `convertToAssets` function and rebalances funds across vaults automatically.
* **Adaptive Learning:** It refines its strategies over time based on historical performance and emerging trends, ensuring the treasury is always pursuing the best opportunities.

In short, the Talos vault strategy turns a collection of individual ERC4626 vaults into a single, agile treasury that maximizes yield while managing risk, all anchored by the consistent value of ETH.
