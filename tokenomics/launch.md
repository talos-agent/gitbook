# Launch

## Launch Strategy

Talos is set to launch with a **fair launch** model designed to ensure broad community participation, transparency, and long-term value creation. This launch strategy is integral to our vision of building a robust, AI-managed treasury with decentralized governance and dynamic yield strategies on Arbitrum.

### Fair Launch and Preseeded Liquidity

* **Fair Launch:**\
  Talos will be launched with a fair distribution mechanism that allows all participants to join on equal footing. No preferential treatment is given, and the token distribution is managed in a way that promotes widespread community engagement.
* **Preseeded Liquidity:**\
  In order to establish a solid foundation, the team will preseed liquidity at the floor backing value. This liquidity is **bonded by the team** to ensure a strong base of value and confidence in the protocol.
  * **Locked Liquidity:**\
    The preseeded liquidity will be locked and utilized for initial protocol management, serving as a safeguard and a resource to support early-stage yield opportunities.
  * **Backing Value:**\
    By bonding liquidity at a set floor value, Talos creates a reserve that underpins the token’s value and helps prevent price volatility during the early stages.

### Inflation and Bonding Mechanisms

To incentivize community participation and support protocol growth, Talos incorporates carefully designed inflationary mechanisms:

* **Bonding Mechanism:**\
  New liquidity can be bonded into the protocol, creating an inflationary supply that rewards participants. This process not only encourages long-term commitment but also ensures that the treasury is continually bolstered by fresh capital.
* **Staking Rewards:**\
  Staking is a core pillar of Talos’s economic design. Participants who stake their tokens help secure the protocol and enable the AI-driven treasury to deploy capital into high-yield strategies. In return, they earn rewards that are distributed through inflationary emissions.
  * For more details on how staking rewards work and the cooperative dynamics behind them, please refer to our Staking page.

### A Launch Built for Long-Term Growth

Talos’s launch strategy is aligned with its broader vision:

* **Transparency:**\
  The fair launch and preseeded liquidity model ensures that every participant can verify the protocol’s initial conditions on-chain, establishing trust from day one.
* **Security and Stability:**\
  With liquidity locked and bonded at the floor value, the protocol is well-capitalized to handle early-stage market fluctuations and provide a stable base for further growth.
* **Community-Driven Inflation:**\
  The inflation via bonding and staking rewards is designed to promote deep, coordinated participation. As more participants bond and stake their tokens, the protocol’s treasury grows—amplifying the yield-bearing opportunities across the Arbitrum ecosystem.
* **Alignment with the Talos Vision:**\
  This launch model perfectly complements Talos’s core elements: an AI-managed treasury, decentralized governance, yield-focused tokenomics, and stag hunt dynamics that incentivize deep, cooperative participation. It sets the stage for Talos to evolve into a fully autonomous and continuously improving ecosystem.

In summary, Talos’s launch is engineered to establish a resilient foundation for long-term growth. By combining fair launch practices, preseeded and locked liquidity, and inflation mechanisms through bonding and staking, Talos creates an environment where collective action drives sustainable success.
