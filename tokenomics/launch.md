# Launch

## Our Launch Strategy

Talos will launch with a **fair launch** model to ensure everyone can participate on equal terms. Our goal is to build a strong, AI-managed treasury with decentralized governance and dynamic yield strategies on Arbitrum.

### Fair Launch and Pre-seeded Liquidity

* **Fair Launch:**\
  Talos will have a fair distribution, with no special treatment for any group. This approach encourages broad community participation from day one.
* **Pre-seeded Liquidity:**\
  The team will provide the initial liquidity, which will be bonded at the token's floor price. This ensures a stable foundation for the protocol.
  * **Locked Liquidity:**\
    This initial liquidity will be locked and used for protocol management, providing a safeguard and resource for early yield opportunities.
  * **Backed Value:**\
    By bonding liquidity at a set floor price, we create a reserve that supports the token's value and helps reduce price volatility in the early stages.

### Inflation and Bonding

To encourage community participation and growth, Talos includes carefully designed inflation mechanisms:

* **Bonding:**\
  Users can bond new liquidity into the protocol, which creates new tokens as a reward. This not only encourages long-term commitment but also ensures the treasury is continuously supplied with fresh capital.
* **Staking Rewards:**\
  Staking is a key part of our economic model. Participants who stake their tokens help secure the protocol and allow the AI-managed treasury to deploy capital into high-yield strategies. In return, they earn rewards from new token emissions.
  * For more details on how staking rewards work, please see our Staking page.

### A Launch Built for Long-Term Growth

Our launch strategy is designed to support our long-term vision:

* **Transparency:**\
  The fair launch and pre-seeded liquidity model means that anyone can verify the protocol’s initial state on-chain, building trust from the start.
* **Security and Stability:**\
  With locked liquidity bonded at a floor price, the protocol is well-capitalized to handle early market changes and provide a stable base for growth.
* **Community-Driven Growth:**\
  Inflation from bonding and staking is designed to encourage deep, coordinated participation. As more users bond and stake, the protocol’s treasury grows, opening up more yield opportunities across the Arbitrum ecosystem.
* **Aligned with Our Vision:**\
  This launch model perfectly complements our core features: an AI Protocol Owner, an AI-managed treasury, community-collaborative governance, yield-focused tokenomics, and a "stag hunt" dynamic that rewards cooperation. It sets the stage for Talos to become a fully autonomous and continuously improving ecosystem.

In short, the Talos launch is designed to create a strong foundation for long-term growth. By combining a fair launch, pre-seeded liquidity, and community-driven inflation, we are building an environment where collective action leads to sustainable success.
