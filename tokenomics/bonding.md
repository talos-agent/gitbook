# Bonding

Bonding in Talos allows you to buy our native token with ETH at a discount. This process is designed to strengthen the treasury and promote long-term growth, all while being managed by our AI-driven framework.

### Overview

Bonding is a simple way for you to contribute ETH and receive our token in return. The process is designed to support the long-term stability and value of the Talos ecosystem. By using a dynamic, AI-managed release strategy, the protocol maintains a healthy inflation rate and ensures that the token distribution aligns with the overall health of the treasury.

### How Bonding Works

#### Asset Exchange

* **Contribute ETH:** You deposit ETH, which is then converted into the protocol token based on a set bond formula.
* **Get a Discount:** The tokens are issued at a discount to the current market price, rewarding you for your early participation and commitment.

#### Time-Locked Vesting

* **Gradual Release:** Instead of receiving all your tokens at once, they are released over a set vesting period.
* **Stability and Incentives:** This vesting schedule prevents sudden price shocks and encourages long-term participation.

### Dynamic Rate Adjustment

Talos uses an AI-driven system to adjust the token release rate on the fly. This system is designed to:

* **Maintain Sustainable Inflation:** The AI continuously monitors the protocol's performance and market conditions to fine-tune the token release schedule.
* **Strengthen the Treasury:** Adjustments are made to balance the token supply with treasury growth, ensuring that rewards remain competitive while protecting long-term value.
* **Respond to the Market:** In times of high demand or market volatility, the system adapts to maintain a healthy balance between token issuance and market supply.

### Single-Token Focus

Initially, the bonding process will only involve a single native token. This allows for simpler operations and clear, targeted incentives, ensuring that every ETH contribution directly supports the protocolâ€™s treasury and yield strategies.

### Conclusion

The Talos bonding mechanism is a key part of our strategy to combine advanced AI management with strong community collaboration. By offering a structured, dynamic approach to token issuance, Talos ensures that every participant helps build a resilient and sustainable financial ecosystem, with the AI Protocol Owner at the helm. This approach supports our commitment to long-term value and strategic growth in DeFi.
