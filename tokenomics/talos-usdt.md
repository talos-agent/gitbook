### Introduction

The **Talos Token (TALOS)** is the core asset powering the Talos Protocol — a next-generation ecosystem built to unlock value through decentralized coordination. TALOS was launched on **Arbitrum** on July 15, 2025, with a fixed maximum supply of **300 million tokens**.

To establish a sustainable foundation for growth, the launch incorporated a **12-hour descending tax mechanism**. This approach generated the initial protocol treasury while ensuring early price stability and fairer distribution dynamics.

### Token Allocation

* **Team Allocation:** 5% (15,000,000 TALOS)\
  Reserved to support long-term development, infrastructure, and growth. Tokens allocated to the team are subject to time-based vesting to ensure long-term alignment with the protocol’s success.

### Key Highlights

* **Mintable:** The token is mintable to support future growth opportunities
* **Fair Launch Dynamics:** A timed tax mechanism protected early buyers while bootstrapping the treasury.
* **Builder-Aligned Incentives:** Team allocation is modest and structured for sustainability.
