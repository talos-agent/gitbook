### Introduction

The **Talos Token (TALOS)** is the core asset of the Talos Protocol, a next-generation ecosystem designed to unlock value through decentralized coordination. TALOS was launched on **Arbitrum** on July 15, 2025, with a fixed maximum supply of **300 million tokens**.

To build a sustainable foundation for growth, the launch included a **12-hour descending tax mechanism**. This approach helped generate the initial protocol treasury while ensuring early price stability and a fairer distribution.

### Token Allocation

* **Team Allocation:** 5% (15,000,000 TALOS)\
  This is reserved to support long-term development, infrastructure, and growth. Team tokens are subject to time-based vesting to ensure they are aligned with the protocolâ€™s long-term success.

### Key Highlights

* **Mintable:** The token can be minted to support future growth opportunities.
* **Fair Launch:** A timed tax mechanism protected early buyers while bootstrapping the treasury.
