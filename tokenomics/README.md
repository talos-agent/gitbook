# Tokenomics

Talos’s tokenomics are engineered to support its high-coordination, high-yield model. The native TALOS token underpins the entire ecosystem—serving as both the medium of exchange and the unit of governance. Here’s how it all comes together:

### Treasury-Backed Value

* **Asset-Backed Security:**\
  TALOS is backed by a diversified treasury of yield-bearing assets native to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This tangible reserve creates a floor of intrinsic value that grounds the token’s market price.
* **Dynamic Supply and Reward Distribution:**\
  Staking rewards are dynamically minted along a bonding curve, which scales with the level of cooperative staking. As more users stake and the treasury grows, the protocol mints additional tokens proportionally—ensuring that rewards are value-supported rather than purely inflationary.

### Protocol-Owned Liquidity and Capital Efficiency

* **Pooling and Efficient Deployment:**\
  By owning significant liquidity and pooling assets, Talos can deploy capital across a suite of yield strategies with greater efficiency. This shared pool minimizes risk while maximizing returns.
* **Value Accrual:**\
  As the treasury earns yield, profits are either reinvested or used to buy back TALOS tokens, thereby increasing their backing. This continuous value loop ensures that long-term stakers benefit directly from the protocol’s success.

### Governance and Utility

* **Unified Token Model:**\
  TALOS serves both as a governance token and as a means to access staking rewards. This unified approach prevents utility fragmentation and concentrates value within a single asset.
* **Demand and Sinking Mechanisms:**\
  Additional use cases (such as collateral for vault access or fee reductions) create organic demand, ensuring that the token’s value is sustained as the ecosystem grows.

Talos’s tokenomics are designed to create a **self-reinforcing economy**: the more the community collaborates through staking and active governance, the stronger the treasury grows, which in turn enhances token value and rewards.
