# Governance

Talos utilizes an upgradeable governance framework that leverages social media for transparent, public decision-making. This system ensures that token stakers actively support their chosen delegates—referred to as governance stewards—who manage proposals and facilitate voting.

### Key Components

#### 1. Token Staking and Delegation

* **Staking Requirement:**\
  Users stake tokens to gain voting power and commit to the governance process. This mechanism ensures that participants have a vested interest in the protocol's success.
* **Delegates’ Role:**\
  Delegates register their social media handles (initially on X/Twitter) to be publicly accountable, representing community sentiment and overseeing governance proposals.
* **Delegation Incentives:**\
  Active delegation is rewarded with enhanced voting power or additional token benefits, whereas non-delegators receive reduced rewards. This incentivizes responsible participation and active engagement.
* **Equal Influence:**\
  Every delegate wields equal influence, irrespective of the stake size, ensuring that governance remains balanced and community-focused.

#### 2. Social Media Integration for Voting

* **Voting via Social Media:**\
  Voting is conducted through social media polls on X/Twitter, with only registered delegates eligible to vote. This approach ties governance decisions to verifiable, public identities.
* **Regular Steward Renewal:**\
  A monthly voting process is implemented to ensure that delegates remain active and accountable. This regular renewal maintains the integrity and responsiveness of the governance system.
* **Proposal Submission:**\
  Anyone can submit proposals for consideration by the delgates

#### 3. Participation and Accountability Mechanisms

* **Mandatory Voting:**\
  Delegates are required to participate in every governance vote. Non-participation incurs penalties, enforcing a consistent level of engagement.
* **Delegate Reassignment:**\
  Inactive delegates can be replaced, ensuring that the pool of governance stewards remains dynamic and responsive to the community’s needs.

### Process Flow

#### Onboarding and Staking

* **Token Staking:**\
  Users stake tokens to gain governance rights and select a delegate. The system of benefits and penalties encourages responsible delegation and active participation.

#### Proposal Lifecycle

* **Submission:**\
  Proposals are submitted with a nominal token deposit, ensuring that only serious ideas are considered.
* **Community Screening:**\
  Submitted proposals are screened by the community before being posted as social media polls.
* **Voting:**\
  Registered delegates participate in the voting process via X/Twitter polls, ensuring that decisions are made transparently and publicly.

#### Post-Vote Enforcement

* **Results Aggregation:**\
  Voting outcomes are aggregated and published, offering clear insights into the community’s preferences.
* **Reward Distribution:**\
  Rewards are distributed to active participants, and penalties are imposed on non-participants to maintain high levels of accountability.
* **Ongoing Steward Votes:**\
  Monthly steward votes help maintain an active and accountable delegate pool, ensuring that governance remains effective and adaptive.

### Conclusion

Talos's upgradeable governance framework integrates token staking, social media-based voting, and robust accountability mechanisms to ensure transparent, responsible, and community-driven decision-making. This system aligns the interests of all participants, fostering a resilient and dynamic governance structure.
