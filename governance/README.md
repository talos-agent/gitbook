# How Governance Works in Talos

Talos is governed by its community. We use a system that combines token staking with social media to make sure that everyone has a voice and that decisions are made in the open.

## The Basics

### 1. Staking and Delegation

*   **Stake Your Tokens:** To vote, you need to stake your tokens. This shows that you have a vested interest in the future of the protocol.
*   **Choose a Delegate:** You can delegate your vote to a "governance steward" who will vote on your behalf. These are community members who have registered their social media handles (starting with X/Twitter) to be publicly accountable.
*   **Incentives for Delegating:** You'll get more rewards if you delegate your vote. If you don't delegate, you'll get fewer rewards. This encourages everyone to participate.
*   **Everyone is Equal:** Every delegate has the same amount of power, no matter how many tokens they have staked. This keeps things fair and community-focused.

### 2. Voting on Social Media

*   **Public Voting:** All voting happens on X/Twitter polls, and only registered delegates can vote. This makes the whole process transparent and public.
*   **Keeping Delegates Active:** We hold a vote every month to make sure that our delegates are still active and accountable.
*   **Anyone Can Make a Proposal:** Anyone can submit a proposal for the delegates to consider.

### 3. Accountability

*   **Voting is Mandatory:** Delegates have to vote on every proposal. If they don't, they'll be penalized.
*   **Replacing Inactive Delegates:** If a delegate is inactive, they can be replaced. This keeps our governance system healthy and responsive.

## The Process

### Getting Started

*   **Stake Your Tokens:** Stake your tokens to get the right to vote and choose a delegate.

### How a Proposal Becomes a Reality

*   **Submission:** To submit a proposal, you need to make a small token deposit. This is to make sure that only serious proposals are considered.
*   **Community Review:** The community will review all proposals before they are put to a vote.
*   **The Vote:** The registered delegates will vote on the proposal using an X/Twitter poll.

### After the Vote

*   **See the Results:** The results of the vote will be published for everyone to see.
*   **Rewards and Penalties:** Rewards will be given to those who participated, and penalties will be given to those who didn't.
*   **Monthly Delegate Votes:** We hold a vote every month to keep our pool of delegates active and accountable.

## Our Goal

We've designed our governance system to be transparent, responsible, and community-driven. By aligning everyone's interests, we can build a resilient and dynamic system that can adapt to whatever comes our way.
