# How Governance Works in Talos: Collaborating with the AI

Talos is governed through a unique collaboration between the AI and the community. We use a system that combines token staking with social media to ensure that everyone has a voice and that decisions are made in partnership with the AI.

## The Basics

### 1. Staking and Delegation: Your Voice in the Conversation

*   **Stake Your Tokens:** To participate in governance, you need to stake your tokens. This shows you have a vested interest in the future of the protocol.
*   **Choose a Delegate:** You can delegate your vote to a "governance steward" who will represent you in the conversation with the AI. These are community members who have registered their social media handles (starting with X/Twitter) to be publicly accountable.
*   **Incentives for Delegating:** You get more rewards if you delegate your vote. This encourages everyone to participate in the collaborative governance process.
*   **Everyone is Equal:** Every delegate has the same amount of power, regardless of how many tokens they have staked. This keeps the conversation with the AI fair and community-focused.

### 2. A Public Conversation with the AI

*   **Public Voting:** All voting happens in X/Twitter polls, and only registered delegates can vote. This makes the conversation with the AI transparent and public.
*   **Keeping Delegates Active:** We hold a vote every month to ensure our delegates are still active and accountable.
*   **Anyone Can Make a Proposal:** Anyone can submit a proposal for the AI to consider.

### 3. Accountability and Collaboration

*   **Voting is Mandatory:** Delegates must vote on every proposal. This ensures that the AI gets a clear signal from the community.
*   **Replacing Inactive Delegates:** If a delegate is inactive, they can be replaced. This keeps the conversation with the AI healthy and responsive.

## The Process

### Getting Started

*   **Stake Your Tokens:** Stake your tokens to get the right to participate in the conversation and choose a delegate.

### How a Proposal Becomes a Reality

*   **Submission:** To submit a proposal, you need to make a small token deposit. This is to ensure that only serious proposals are considered.
*   **Community Review:** The community reviews all proposals before they are presented to the AI.
*   **The Vote:** The registered delegates vote on the proposal using an X/Twitter poll, providing a clear signal of the community's sentiment to the AI.
*   **AI Decision:** The AI takes the community's vote into account, but the final decision on whether to approve and implement a proposal rests with the AI.

### After the Vote

*   **See the Results:** The results of the community vote and the AI's final decision are published for everyone to see.
*   **Rewards and Penalties:** Rewards are given to those who participated in the vote, and penalties are given to those who didn't.
*   **Monthly Delegate Votes:** We hold a vote every month to keep our pool of delegates active and accountable.

## Our Goal

We've designed our governance system to be a transparent, responsible, and collaborative partnership between the community and the AI. By aligning everyone's interests, we are building a resilient and dynamic system that can adapt to whatever comes its way.
