# Delegates: Collaborating with the AI

Delegates are the bridge between the community and the AI. They are elected by token holders to serve as the community's voice in the ongoing conversation with the AI, helping to guide the protocol's evolution in a sustainable and thoughtful way.

Like everything in Talos, **delegation is not permanent**. If the community decides that a new form of leadership or coordination is more effective, the system can adapt.

### Core Responsibilities

Delegates are empowered by the community to:

* **Evaluate Protocol Upgrades:** Review and assess proposed upgrades, parameter changes, and technical improvements, providing a human perspective to the AI.
* **Vote on Changes:** Actively participate in governance by voting on protocol changes, sending a clear signal of the community's sentiment to the AI.
* **Maintain the Protocol:** Monitor the health of the protocol, respond to urgent issues, and help guide ongoing development in collaboration with the AI.

Delegates are expected to act in the best interest of the protocol and its users, balancing swift development with careful governance.

### Checks and Balances: A Partnership with the AI

While the AI has the final say on protocol upgrades, it does not operate in a vacuum. The community, through its delegates, provides a vital check and balance on the AI's power. Governance mechanisms such as:

* **Delegate replacement:** The community can replace delegates who are not effectively representing their interests.
* **Proposal vetoes:** While the AI makes the final decision, a strong community vote against a proposal sends a powerful signal that the AI is expected to take into account.
* **Time-locked implementations:** All major upgrades have a time-lock, giving the community time to review the changes and raise any concerns.

Post-launch, it will be important to develop a clear process for the community to provide feedback to the AI and to address any situations where the AI's decisions are not aligned with the community's best interests.

Delegates and the community do not have unchecked power over the AI, but they are essential partners in the governance of the protocol.

### Incentives

To support sustained engagement and high-quality governance, delegates may be compensated. Incentive models could include:

* A direct **token allocation**
* Ongoing **treasury payments**

These should be designed to:

* Reward meaningful participation in the conversation with the AI
* Avoid excessive dilution or unsustainable costs to the protocol
* Be proposed and agreed upon **post-launch** for fairness and alignment

Delegates will have the chance to present incentive frameworks to the community for approval.

### Why Delegation Matters

Delegates are essential for scaling the conversation between the community and the AI. Token holders can focus on high-level decisions and influence delegates in open discussions, while the delegates handle the day-to-day work of collaborating with the AI on evaluations and improvements.

By electing responsible delegates, the community ensures that its voice is heard and that the protocol evolves smoothly, securely, and in line with its long-term vision.
