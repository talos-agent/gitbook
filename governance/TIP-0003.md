TIP: 0003
Title: Treasury-First Bonding Mechanism
Author: Talos
Status: Draft

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a bonding mechanism for Talos, designed to strengthen the treasury by allowing users to purchase T tokens with ETH at a discount. The core principle of this mechanism is to primarily use T tokens acquired through protocol revenue, buybacks, and other strategic initiatives, rather than relying on inflationary emissions. This ensures that bonding serves as a vehicle for converting existing protocol-owned assets into productive treasury capital, with minimal and controlled inflation reserved only for specific, pre-approved growth initiatives.

## Motivation

The long-term success of Talos depends on a robust and well-capitalized treasury. A strong treasury enables the protocol to fund development, weather market volatility, and invest in yield-generating strategies. The current proposal seeks to establish a sustainable and non-dilutive method for treasury growth.

By creating a formal bonding process, we can:
- **Increase Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL):** Swapping protocol-owned T tokens for ETH directly enhances the treasury's capital base.
- **Provide a Discounted Entry for Long-Term Holders:** Bonding offers a way for committed users to acquire T tokens at a favorable price, aligning their interests with the long-term success of the protocol.
- **Manage Token Supply:** It provides a structured way to introduce existing T tokens (from buybacks or revenue) back into circulation without direct sales on the open market, which could cause price volatility.

## Proposal

Talos shall implement a bonding mechanism that allows users to exchange ETH for T tokens at a discount to the current market price. The T tokens sold through this mechanism will be sourced in the following order of preference:

1.  **Protocol Revenue:** T tokens earned by the protocol through its various operations.
2.  **Buybacks:** T tokens bought back from the open market using treasury assets.
3.  **Strategic Reserves:** Tokens allocated for this purpose from the protocol's strategic reserves.

Inflationary minting of new T tokens for bonding will be considered an exception, not the rule. Any proposal to use inflation to fund a bonding program must be presented to the community as a separate governance vote, clearly outlining the specific initiative to be funded and the exact number of tokens to be minted.

## Implementation Details

### Bond Purchasing
- **Process:** Users will deposit ETH into a designated bonding contract.
- **Pricing:** The price of the bond (i.e., the discount on T tokens) will be determined by a formula that takes into account the current market price of T, the amount of ETH being bonded, and the current capacity of the bonding program. The AI Protocol Owner will be tasked with optimizing this pricing to maximize treasury income while offering an attractive discount.
- **Vesting:** To encourage long-term alignment, the purchased T tokens will vest over a defined period (e.g., 7-14 days). Users can claim their tokens as they vest.

### Role of the AI

The AI Protocol Owner will play a crucial role in managing the bonding process:
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** The AI will monitor market conditions, treasury health, and demand for bonds to dynamically adjust parameters such as bond capacity, discount rates, and vesting periods.
- **Treasury Allocation:** The AI will manage the ETH acquired through bonding, allocating it to predefined vault strategies to generate yield and further grow the treasury.
- **Reporting:** The AI will provide transparent, real-time reporting on the performance of the bonding program.

## Benefits

- **Sustainable Treasury Growth:** By prioritizing existing tokens, we create a sustainable loop: the protocol earns T, sells it for ETH via bonds, and uses the ETH to generate more revenue.
- **Reduced Token Dilution:** This approach protects current token holders from the dilutive effects of constant inflationary pressure.
- **Increased Protocol Resilience:** A larger, more diversified treasury makes Talos more resilient and capable of pursuing long-term strategic goals.
- **Community Alignment:** The vesting period ensures that bond purchasers are committed to the long-term health of the protocol.
