# Upgradeability

### Overview

Talos is built to adapt. As the protocol grows, so too must the intelligence that manages its treasury. The **Talos AI Agent** is designed to evolve in response to new strategies, emerging technologies, and changing market conditions. Upgradeability is a first-class citizen in the system—made possible through **modular smart contracts** and an active, **decentralized governance layer**.

***

### Modular & Upgradeable Architecture

Talos is structured to allow seamless upgrades without disrupting ongoing operations.

* **Modular Contracts:** Core functionality is split into upgradable modules.
* **Composable Strategies:** ERC4626 vaults allow plug-and-play support for new strategies.
* **Safe Evolution:** Changes are versioned and auditable, with rollback support in case of emergency.

This ensures that the AI agent’s logic, models, and data flows can evolve over time without a full redeploy.

### Governance-Driven AI Evolution

The AI agent that powers Talos isn’t static—it grows smarter with every governance cycle.

#### How Governance Fuels AI Upgradeability

* **Propose Upgrades**\
  Any token holder can submit proposals for agent improvements, including:
  * New investment strategies
  * Risk tolerance adjustments
  * Data sources or oracles
  * Reward distribution logic
  * Behavioral changes in volatile conditions
* **Delegate-Led Review**\
  Delegates evaluate and endorse proposals, adding human oversight before implementation.
* **Vote via X (Twitter)**\
  All upgrades pass through a transparent, public voting process on X.
  * Polls are only open to registered stewards.
  * On-chain logic tracks outcomes and triggers upgrades after passing thresholds.
* **Continuous Feedback Loops**\
  Regular delegate elections and participation-based incentives ensure upgrades are evaluated frequently and with fresh perspective.

### Talos as a Nomic Protocol

Talos embodies the principles of a nomic system—where the rules of the game are not static but subject to continuous evolution through the very processes they establish.

* **Self-Modifying Rules:**\
  The protocol’s governance framework is designed to be inherently flexible. Changes to the rules governing the AI agent and treasury management can be proposed and enacted by the community, allowing Talos to adapt its own mechanics over time.
* **Dynamic Rulemaking:**\
  Similar to the game of Nomic, every participant in Talos has the opportunity to influence the rules. Whether it’s refining investment strategies or updating security measures, every approved proposal contributes to a continuously evolving protocol.
* **Empowering Collective Evolution:**\
  By allowing token holders and delegates to directly impact the operational logic, Talos ensures that the system can self-correct and improve autonomously. This adaptability is central to managing the complex, shifting landscape of decentralized finance.
* **Transparent & Iterative Process:**\
  All changes are recorded on-chain and made public through social media integration, ensuring that the evolution of the protocol is transparent and subject to community scrutiny. This creates an environment where innovation is encouraged and the protocol is always in a state of improvement.

***

### Contribution Channels

Talos transforms its community into a network of intelligence contributors.

* **Training Data Contributions:**\
  Token holders may supply signals, analytics, or datasets that help refine the AI.
* **Simulation Results:**\
  Backtested strategies or simulations can be attached to proposals to support suggested upgrades.
* **Open Agent Development:**\
  The AI core is open source and modular, allowing external developers to suggest or fork new agent logic.

***

### Safeguards & Security

Upgradeability doesn’t mean instability. Talos includes mechanisms to keep governance secure:

* **Time-Delayed Execution:**\
  All critical upgrades have a built-in delay before activation to allow for community inspection.
* **Slashing for Malicious Behavior:**\
  Delegates who vote for harmful or spammy upgrades risk losing part of their stake.
* **Emergency Pauses:**\
  The protocol retains the ability to temporarily pause AI agent upgrades under community consensus in case of bugs or unexpected behavior.

### Roadmap to Autonomous AI

| Phase       | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Manual proposals for AI behavior, reviewed by multisig + delegate vote |
| **Phase 2** | Community-driven upgrades and live strategy updates via governance     |
| **Phase 3** | Self-improving AI agent with permissioned strategy experimentation     |
| **Phase 4** | Fully autonomous agent proposing and executing upgrades with oversight |



***

### Summary

Talos is more than a yield aggregator—it's a self-evolving organism. The protocol’s **upgradeable AI agent** learns from the community, adapts through governance, and drives collective value creation. With a modular framework, active social-based governance, and a nomic design that allows its rules to evolve, Talos is designed to continuously improve—setting a new standard for agentic DeFi protocols.
