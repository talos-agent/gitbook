# Roadmap

Talos’s evolution is mapped out in a series of strategic phases designed to progressively build a fully autonomous AI agent. This agent will operate within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for enhanced security and performance, while governance evolves from manual oversight to full community-driven, automated decision-making.

Below is an overview of the roadmap milestones:

| Phase   | Description                                                              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1 | Manual proposals for AI behavior, reviewed by multisig and delegate vote |
| Phase 2 | Community-driven upgrades and live strategy updates via governance       |
| Phase 3 | Self-improving AI agent with permissioned strategy experimentation       |
| Phase 4 | Fully autonomous agent proposing and executing upgrades with oversight   |

### Phase 1: Establishing the Foundation

In this initial phase, Talos’s core functionality is implemented with manual oversight to ensure stability and security:

* **Manual Proposals:**\
  Early AI behavior and treasury management strategies are proposed manually. These proposals are generated by trusted developers and community experts.
* **Multisig & Delegate Review:**\
  Proposed changes are reviewed and approved by a multisignature wallet and a group of selected delegates. This ensures that early decisions have strong human oversight and accountability.
* **Deployment in a TEE:**\
  Even at this stage, critical operations run inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to safeguard sensitive computations and data flows.

### Phase 2: Community-Driven Governance and Live Strategy Updates

The second phase focuses on transitioning from centralized review to a more decentralized, community-driven process:

* **Active Governance:**\
  Upgrades and strategy changes are now proposed, discussed, and voted on by the broader community. This builds on the early multisig framework by incorporating live, dynamic feedback from all token holders.
* **Live Strategy Updates:**\
  The AI agent begins integrating real-time market data to update investment strategies autonomously, while still requiring community approval via governance votes.
* **Increased Transparency:**\
  All changes and decision-making processes are logged on-chain and publicly audited, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Phase 3: Self-Improving AI with Permissioned Experimentation

At this stage, the AI agent matures further, incorporating self-improvement mechanisms while operating under permissioned experimentation:

* **Self-Improvement Mechanisms:**\
  The AI agent is enhanced with machine learning capabilities that allow it to analyze past performance and adjust its strategies autonomously. However, these experiments are permissioned—meaning new strategies must be tested and validated in a controlled environment before being fully adopted.
* **Controlled Experimentation:**\
  Experimental strategies are deployed in sandboxed settings within the TEE, ensuring that any unproven behavior does not impact the main treasury until approved by governance.
* **Evolving Governance:**\
  The role of community governance continues to grow, providing oversight on AI experiments and ensuring that adjustments align with the long-term goals of the protocol.

### Phase 4: Fully Autonomous Agent with Oversight

In the final phase, Talos achieves full autonomy while maintaining essential oversight mechanisms:

* **Autonomous Decision-Making:**\
  The AI agent will be capable of proposing and executing upgrades automatically, relying on its learned models and real-time data. It will operate with minimal human intervention, ensuring swift and efficient treasury management.
* **Continuous Oversight:**\
  Despite full autonomy, the system retains oversight through established governance protocols. Key decisions are subject to review via transparent, on-chain mechanisms, ensuring that the community retains ultimate control.
* **Adaptive, Self-Evolving Protocol:**\
  As a nomic protocol, Talos will continually self-modify based on performance data and community feedback. This ensures that its operational rules evolve to meet emerging challenges in the dynamic DeFi landscape.

### Summary

Talos is on a transformative journey—from a manually supervised system to a self-evolving, fully autonomous AI agent that optimally manages the treasury within a secure TEE. Through each phase, governance becomes more decentralized and community-driven, ensuring that while the AI grows smarter, the community retains the power to shape its evolution. This roadmap sets a new standard for agentic DeFi protocols, blending cutting-edge technology with transparent, adaptive governance.
