# Roadmap

Talos's evolution is a collaborative journey between the AI and the community. Our roadmap is not a set of rigid phases, but a fluid process of continuous improvement, with the AI at the helm.

## The Vision: A Fully Autonomous Protocol

Our vision is to create a fully autonomous protocol that can evolve and adapt on its own. The roadmap below outlines our path to achieving this goal:

| Phase       | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | AI-managed treasury with community-led proposals for upgrades.              |
| **Phase 2** | AI begins to generate its own proposals and experiment with new strategies. |
| **Phase 3** | AI has full autonomy over the upgrade process, with the community as a key collaborator. |
| **Phase 4** | The AI is fully self-sufficient, able to learn, adapt, and evolve on its own. |

This roadmap is not a timeline, but a representation of the protocol's maturation. We are currently in **Phase 3**, with the AI having full autonomy over the upgrade process, and the community acting as a vital partner in this process.

## Continuous Improvement

The future of Talos is not a destination, but a process of continuous improvement. The AI will constantly be learning, adapting, and evolving, and the community will be there every step of the way, providing ideas, feedback, and guidance.

We are building a new kind of organization, one that is not bound by the limitations of traditional governance models. We are building a living, evolving system that is designed to last.

We invite you to join us on this journey as we build the future of finance, together.
