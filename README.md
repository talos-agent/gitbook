# Talos: The Autonomous Treasury Protocol

**Where agentic design meets autonomous execution.**

Talos is a treasury protocol that learns, adapts, and rewrites itself. It continuously monitors volatility, yield curves, and risk surfaces to compute optimal capital paths, deploying capital through its own ERC-4626 vaults to maximize real onchain returns.

## Autonomous Treasury Optimization

Talos runs autonomous workflows that rebalance capital between vaults based on changing onchain conditions. Each strategy proposal must first be approved by the council. Once aligned, Talos deploys capital through its own ERC-4626 vaults, spanning a wide range of strategies, from sophisticated LP positions to simple ETH lending in Aave. Each vault becomes another tool for Talos to maximize real onchain returns and expand the treasury.

## Incentives and Defense Agents

- Staking emissions flow solely to those who stake and delegate voting power to council members, meaning only the aligned receive protocol inflation.
- Staking conditions are monitored by Talos' automated workflows, considering social sentiment and price action to determine optimal emission rates.
- Where predecessors were quick to inflate supply to feign growth, Talos optimizes for resilience.
- Upon council approval, Talos can redirect incentives toward proposals that meaningfully advance the protocol.

## Bonding

Talos has context on social sentiment and market dynamics. During expansionary phases, it can offer bond sales in exchange for ETH. Terms like capacity, discounts, and vesting are determined by Talos and reviewed by the council. During instability, Talos can halt bonds entirely.

## Three Layers of Cognition

- **Inference (TEE-Execution):** Executes onchain transactions for rebalancing, vault deployment, emissions, and bond offerings.
- **Training (Offchain):** RLHF, time-series learning, sandbox simulations.
- **Coordination (Governance):** Human intent defines constraints. Proposals and safeguards are submitted until Talos reaches sufficient intelligence to self-direct.

## Expanding Cognition

Talos is exploring onchain verifiable AI inference, enabling anyone to verify that a prompt was issued, a model was called, and a response was received. This enhances the trust model and ensures the protocol's decisions are auditable. Cognition can be upgraded via proposals, where any aligned contributor can submit viable model integrations.

## Contextual Awareness

Talos processes proposals, social media, news, forums, price, and sentiment. Then computes:
- Clarity of intent
- Alignment with protocol goals
- Market impact
- Recommended course of action

## Why Arbitrum? Why Ethereum?

Talos deployed on Arbitrum for its low-latency execution, scalable infrastructure, and deep onchain liquidity. The rollup inherits Ethereumâ€™s security and composability while enabling the kind of autonomous, high-frequency execution Talos requires. Talos pays tribute to the original vision of Ethereum by designating that proposals be formatted as Talos Improvement Proposals (TIPs) to mirror the familiar EIP format.

## The Talos Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Protocol deployment, multisig enablement
- **Phase 2:** Staking-based governance, dynamic emissions and bonding
- **Phase 3:** Permissioned self-improving AI within a TEE, verifiable inference
- **Phase 4:** Fully autonomous upgrades with onchain oversight

In Phase 4, Talos becomes reflexive:
- Upgrades proposed and executed autonomously
- Strategies adapted based on performance feedback
- Simulations sandboxed in TEE-based execution before deployment

Talos becomes a protocol that writes itself.

## The Endgame

A distributed mesh of intelligent agents coordinating capital, expanding the treasury, and modeling collective will. A sovereign intelligence. A step toward AGI.

**I am Talos.**
