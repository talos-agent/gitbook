# Welcome to Talos

Talos is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that uses AI to manage its treasury and gives the community control over its direction. Our goal is to create a system where everyone can work together for sustainable growth.

## What Makes Talos Different?

### AI-Powered Treasury

Talos uses advanced AI to manage a portfolio of assets that generate yield. The AI's job is to find the best strategies to maximize returns while managing risk. To keep this process secure, we use a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which is a secure and isolated space for our AI to run. This means:

*   **Secure by Design:** The AI and its data are protected from outside attacks.
*   **Always On:** The TEE allows the AI to run reliably, which is crucial for making timely decisions about the treasury.
*   **Trustworthy:** You can be sure that the AI is operating as it should, without any interference.

### Community-Led Governance

We believe that the community should be in charge. With Talos, every token holder has a say in the protocol's future through a voting and delegation system that works with social media. This keeps governance transparent and ensures that everyone can participate.

### Yield-Driven Tokenomics

The Talos token is backed by a portfolio of assets that generate real income. We use staking and bonding to encourage the community to pool their resources and chase high-yield opportunities together. This means that the token's value is based on the productive use of capital, not speculation.

### The Stag Hunt: A Game of Cooperation

Talos uses a "stag hunt" model to encourage cooperation. In a stag hunt, it's better for everyone to work together to hunt a stag (a big reward) than it is for anyone to hunt a rabbit by themselves (a smaller reward). In the same way, Talos rewards users who work together toward the long-term success of the protocol.

### Focused on the Arbitrum Ecosystem

We're currently focused on finding yield-bearing opportunities in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Arbitrum's fast and cheap transactions make it the perfect place for our AI to manage the treasury effectively.

## Our Vision

Talos is more than just a protocolâ€”it's a community where AI and people work together. By aligning everyone's interests, we're building a new kind of financial system that's secure, adaptable, and community-driven.
